/* Motors - motors_home.c
 *
 * Purpose: move the mount to the home position.
 *
 * Always stops any motion in progress before enqueuing the home SLEW.
 * Without the explicit stop, a SLEWING mount would ignore the new command
 * because the motion task does not poll the queue while executing a slew.
