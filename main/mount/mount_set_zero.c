/* Mount - mount_set_zero.c
 *
 * Purpose: reset the axis position counters so the current physical
 * orientation becomes the new zero / home reference.
 *
 * Useful for worm-gear mounts where the user manually positions the
 * mount to a known orientation and wants the software to treat that
 * point as the origin.
